I rebuild the whole project, I made an POSTMAN project so instructors can test my work.

Capstone Project Instructions

Add the google-services.json in the app in order to run the app.

Next, you can test the app by sending POST Request.

I upload my POSTMAN project if you want to send requests. Change the <YOUR KEY> with your server key.

/topics/key_channel1 ,key_channel1
